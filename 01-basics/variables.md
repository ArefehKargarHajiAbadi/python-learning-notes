# chapter 01: Variables

## 1.what is variable?
A **variable** is named storage in program's memory where can store data like numbrs,text or Boolean values.
The primary way to create a variable in Python is to assign it a value using the assignment operator.
## 2. Definition of variable 
In Python, you don't need to specify the type of a variable when defining it. 
Python automatically detects the type based on the value you assign.

```python
  name = "Ali"  # Python knows this is an integer
  age = 26	    # Python knows this is an integer
  is_student = True # Python knows this is a Boolean
```
You should use snake case for multi-word names to improve readability. For  example:number_of_students
